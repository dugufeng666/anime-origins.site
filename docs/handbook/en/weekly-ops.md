title: "Chapter 8 · Weekly Freshness and Growth: The 30-Minute Rhythm"
description: "Monday: freshness check, codes update, topic picks from data. Monthly: upstream sync, revenue review. Quarterly: SEO check. A fixed rhythm is the whole secret."

tldr: "Every Monday, 30 minutes, three things: run pnpm refresh-audit and let the site report its own stale pages (feed the report to the AI to turn it into todos), update the codes (one prompt or slash command), and read GSC data to pick next week's topics. Monthly, sync the upstream updates (three commands; let the AI handle conflicts). Once site number one works, site number two costs almost nothing extra."

## Where you are, and what this chapter solves

The ads are on and the store is officially in business. But game guides fear going stale more than anything: expired codes left unattended, a reworked boss while your guide still teaches the old strategy — a player who finds waste paper once never comes back, and Google hands your rankings to someone else.

This chapter gives you a fixed rhythm: 30 minutes every Monday, 10 minutes every month, 5 minutes every quarter. **A fixed rhythm is the only secret to a site that never goes stale.**

## What you'll have when this chapter is done

- A do-exactly-this weekly action list (copy it into your calendar)
- Fixed monthly and quarterly actions

## Every Monday, 30 minutes

### Action 1: Run the freshness check and turn the report into todos (15 minutes)

**What to do**: let the site tell you which pages have gone stale.
**How to do it**: in the terminal, type:

```bash
pnpm refresh-audit
```

**You'll see**: a list. Two severity levels — **P0, most urgent: a codes page not updated for more than 7 days (past 30 days the problem escalates); P1, next urgent: boss guides and tier lists not updated for more than 90 days** (only those two categories produce P1, because stale versions of them mislead players; other pages never do). Then paste the list to your AI assistant and have it organized into todos:

```text
Here is my pnpm refresh-audit report:
<paste the report>
Turn the P0/P1 items into an actionable checklist:
1. Pages that need new data from me → list page by page exactly what you need (the latest codes list / mechanic changes in the new version)
2. Pages I confirm are still accurate and only need a refresh → update lastModified to today
3. List separately the pages whose gameVersion is behind
Do not modify any content facts on your own. Output as a checkbox list.
```

> Note: the repo's "weekly auto-check that opens an issue" feature **runs only on the official AnvilWiki repository by default — your site does not get the automatic reminder** — which is why you run this yourself every week. You can have GitHub open issues to remind you, too: delete the `if: github.repository ==` line condition in `.github/workflows/content-pipeline.yml` (let your AI assistant delete it — it's a one-sentence job).

### Action 2: Update the codes (10 minutes)

Collect new codes and confirm expired old ones from the official Twitter / Discord, then:

On a skill-capable AI assistant, just say (slash command):

```text
/anvil-update-codes new codes: <code list>; confirmed expired: <code list>
```

Plain-prompt version:

```text
Update the codes article under src/content/wiki/en/codes/: prepend new codes to the front of the frontmatter active array;
change expired codes' status to expired (keep them, do not delete); set lastModified to today; sync the code count and year-month in title/summary;
if other-language versions exist, sync their data too (do not translate the code field; translate copy like reward).
When done, run pnpm check-content && pnpm build; only all-green counts as complete.
```

**Confirm it worked**: the codes page shows the new codes, and expired ones moved into the "Expired" table (kept, not deleted — people still search "do old codes still work", and keeping them catches that long-tail traffic).

### Action 3: Wrap up (5 minutes)

`git push` (Cloudflare reshelves automatically) → open GSC's "Performance" page and see which terms brought clicks these past days → pick 1 to 2 rising terms and write matching new pages next week with the Chapter 4 routine.

## Once a month (10 minutes each)

```bash
# 1. Multi-language sites only: see how much translation is missing
pnpm check-i18n

# 2. Bring in the template author's updates (first time: run all three lines)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/PNGTRID/AnvilWiki.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

What the second group means: register the official repo (called upstream) as the one to watch, pull its latest version, and merge it into your site. **If the terminal shows the word CONFLICT, don't panic**: give the conflicting file names to your AI assistant, say "keep my config and content, follow the official repo for code", and let it resolve them one by one — this step is AI work by nature. The developer manual's "sync" chapter covers it in detail.

Then spend 10 more minutes on the AdSense report: which page types have the highest RPM (usually tier lists and codes) → write more of those next month.

## Every quarter: SEO health check (send this block to your AI assistant)

```text
Run an SEO health check on this site — read-only, change nothing:
1. SITE_URL (wrangler.toml [vars] or .env) contains https:// and is the real domain
2. Every article: title ≤80, description 40–165, summary a direct answer (list the violations)
3. og:image/twitter:image use absolute paths
4. Is noindex misused anywhere
5. Run pnpm check-sitemap; after build, run pnpm check-links and report non-200 / dead links
6. Is multilingual hreflang coverage complete
Output a problem table: file / problem / suggested fix; only change things after I confirm.
```

## The long-term mindset

- Once the first site runs, the second site's marginal cost is tiny — picking, building, producing pages, deploying, operating: you have walked this entire manual once already.
- Keep forgetting the weekly check? Create a repeating Monday reminder in your phone's calendar, titled "30-minute freshness".

## If you get stuck

- **"I can't read the refresh-audit report"**: you don't need to — copy the whole thing and paste it to the AI; the prompt turns it into a todo list.
- **"Monthly merge conflicts"**: hand the conflicted files to the AI with the mantra "keep my config and content, follow the official repo for code".
- **"I keep forgetting to run it"**: a weekly repeating calendar reminder beats willpower.

## ✅ Acceptance criteria (all must hold)

- `pnpm refresh-audit` ran once this week and P0 is zero (the codes page was updated within 7 days)
- ☐ Three weeks running, same time, same three actions
- ☐ You can read GSC's "Performance" page: which terms brought the clicks

## Where to go from here

A three-way fork: **keep running the weekly rhythm**; **go deep with the [developer manual](/landing/docs/architecture) to customize your site** (add categories, add languages, reskin, turn on comments and analytics); or **submit a PR adding your site to the AnvilWiki official showcase wall** (edit the showcase data in `src/config/landing.ts`) — your real case is the best advertisement this template can get.
